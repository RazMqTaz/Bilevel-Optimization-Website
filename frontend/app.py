        "Bilevel optimization, a class of hierarchical optimization problems, presents a significant research challenge due to its inherent NP-hard nature, especially in non-convex settings. In this work, we address the limitations of existing solvers. "
        + "Classical gradient-based methods are often inapplicable to the non-convex and non-differentiable landscapes common in practice, while derivative-free methods like nested evolutionary algorithms are rendered intractable by a prohibitively high query complexity. "
        + "\n\nTo this end, we propose a novel framework, the Surrogate-Assisted Co-evolutionary Evolutionary Strategy (SACE-ES), which synergizes the global search capabilities of evolutionary computation with the data-driven efficiency of surrogate modeling. "
        + "\n\nThe core innovation of our framework is a multi-surrogate, constraint-aware architecture that decouples the complex bilevel problem. We use separate Gaussian Process (GP) models to approximate the lower-level optimal solution vector and its corresponding constraint violations. "
        + "This allows our algorithm to make intelligent, cheap evaluations to guide the search, reserving expensive, true evaluations only for the most informative candidate solutions."
